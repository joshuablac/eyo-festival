                            across Eti-Osa and the several virtual meetings held, the
                            Eti-Osa Youth Organization (EYO) was formed which subsequently
                            resulted to the constitution of the ‘EYO Round Table Discussion Committee’
                            led by Comr. Sodic Ademola Balogun to hold the first physical meeting of youth
                            leaders/representative across Eti-Osa. This round table discussion further consequently
                            brought
                            into the existence of the creation of the EYO Ad-hoc Committees by her founding members.

                        Upon the creation of the EYO Ad-hoc committees, the committees promptly hit the ground running
                        which thereafter resulted to the construction of the organization core structure as a result of
                        the rigorous and unrelenting effort of all members of the Ad-hoc committees. Since the impact of
                        the EYO Ad-hoc committees, EYO has continued to strongly pursued its founding aims by widening
                        its membership with the acceptance of new communities and youth driven
                        Organizations/Unions/Associations/Societies across Eti-Osa for the good of Eti-Osa.
